As a staff member, your responsibilities are varied, but your primary focus will be responding to staff calls and assisting players with issues on the server. These issues can range from minor disputes between players (e.g., disagreements involving FRP, RDM, or VDM) to more serious offenses, such as trolling, mass RDM, or inappropriate behavior, including racial or sexual innuendos. Specific punishments for each infraction are detailed at the end of this section.
Staff members are expected to maintain a professional demeanor at all times, balancing firmness in decision-making with a friendly and approachable attitude. As a role model within the community, you set an example that many players look up to and aspire to follow. This professional standard applies not only during your active duties but also when you are off-duty, as you represent the server at all times.
This handbook provides comprehensive guidelines, including detailed rules and expectations for every rank. For those tasked with handling tickets, additional guidance is included within this document to ensure clarity and consistency in your responsibilities.
